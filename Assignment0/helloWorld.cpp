  Assignment 0 (Hello World)

  The following assignment is to demonstrate C++ code working in the most basic program one can start by writing, the default Hello World script

  The program insludes the following:
	- 'using namespace std' to simplify code throughout and remove the requirement of 'std::'
	- A singular main method that prints out the text "Hello World!"
	- '\n' is included in the print statement to add an extra line to the console

*/

#include <iostream>

using namespace std; //simplifies code throughout the program

int main() {
	cout << "Hello World!\n"; // '\n' prints an extra line after the statement
}
