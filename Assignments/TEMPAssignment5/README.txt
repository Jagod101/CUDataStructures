Assignment 5 - Building a Database with Binary Search Trees

Source Files:
BST.h
DoublyLinkedList.h
Faculty.h
GenStack.h
Member.h
Menu.h
Student.h
Faculty.cpp
Member.cpp
Student.cpp
main.cpp

Runtime Errors:
1) Load File Breaks (creates a blank file)
2) File Output only puts out one node for Student and Faculty (even though code is near exact copy of print function for CMD)
3) Rollback not Implemented (attempted code within but commented out)

DISCLAIMER:
We apologize for the slight few minute delay, we tried our best to fix out runtime errors before submission, but unfortunately that did not happen
To whomever is reading this (we are assuming it's Steve, but it could be Rene) we hope you had a Happy Thanksgiving :)

Instructions:
1. Navigate within the folder (using 'cd')
2. g++ *.cpp to compile an a.out file
3. ./a.out test.in
4. 'cat studentTable.txt' or 'cat facultyTable.txt' after program exits to view printed data
