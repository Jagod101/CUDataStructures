Graphs
- A graph is a set of vertices (Nodes) and a set of edges that connect pairs of distinct values. That is, at most one edge connects any pair of vertices
  - Note that graphs and trees have similar looks and feels. This is because trees are a specific type of graph (Undirected Graph)
- Allow us to not only represent a collection of items, but the connections between them
- The relationships applied by these connections lead to some natural questions:
  - Is there a way to get from one item to another following connections?
  - How many other items can be reached from a given item?
  - What is the best way to get to one item from another item?
- To model such situations, we need a very general data structure that can describe an arbitrary number of items and their connections
- Graph Theory is rooted almost entirely in mathematics
- Examples of the types of problems that make use of graphs:
  - maps
  - hypertexts
  - circuits
  - networks

Graph Terminology
- When there is an edge connecting 2 vertices, they are said to be ADJACENT. The edge is said to be "incident" on both vertices
- The DEGREE of a vertex is the number of edges incident has
- A PATH in a graph is a sequence of vertices in which each successive vertex is adjacent to its predecessor in the path
- If every edge connects a distinct pair of vertices, then we sat that the graph is a SIMPLE GRAPH
- A graph is a CONNECTED GRAPH if there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex. A graph that is not connected consists of a set of connected components, which are maximal connected subgraphs
- A CYCLE is a path for which the first and last vertices are adjacent
