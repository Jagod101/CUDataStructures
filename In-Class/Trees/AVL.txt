AVL Trees
- Balanced Tree
- Named after Adelson-Velskii and Landis
- Rather than worrying about Color, we worry about Height of Left and Right Subtrees
    - Make sure the difference is never more than 1
    - This is called Height Balanced
- We define AVL trees recursively

Definition
- An Empty Tree is Height-Balanced
    - If T is non-empty binary tree with Tl and Tr as left and right subtrees, T is height balanced if and only if Tl and Tr are height balanced (balance factor) and abs(hl-hr)<=1
    - Is either going to be left heavy or right heavy
