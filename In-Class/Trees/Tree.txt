Trees
- consists of nodes with a parent-child relationship

Tree Terminology
- Root: node without a parent
- Internal nodes: node with at least one child
- External nodes (leaf): a node with no children
- Death of a node: number of ancestors
- Height: max depth of any node

Binary Search Tree (BST)
- a tree that allows for efficent sorting and searching
    1) insert

Rules of BST
- Each node (vertex) must have exactly one path (edge) to another node
    1) If it doesn't, then it's a graph
- Each node consists of a key value
    1) Key to sort
- Data entries are sorted
    1) Values smaller than the root, go left
    2) Values greater than the root, go right
- Internal: node that has two children
- External: one or fewer children
    1) leaf = no children
- Node Degree: the number of children of a given node

Balance/Unbalanced Trees
- A tree is "perfectly" height-balanced if the left and right subtrees of any node are the same height
    1) A tree is balanced if the height of the left and right is within 1
